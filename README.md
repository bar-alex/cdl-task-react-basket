Wasn't clear which way you wanted me to make this, so I've done it both ways: 

I've also added a new flag for the products table, where the offer can be given only one (or two or three) times, not specifying it will apply it for all quantities.

Spread mode - like in supermarkets
  - the products are added in the order they are entered, 
  - the values displayed on the same line are for the entire price, without the offers
  - the discounts from the offers are calculated at the end, for the cumulated quantity of each product
  - the total results from the value minus the discounts
Condensed mode
  - the quantities are added to the same products in the list, meaning there will be only one instance of the same product
  - the value is calculated according to the offer and displayed on the same line (the total quantity is on the same line)
  - there is no need to display the savings because the values have the discounts already   substracted 
The total will display the full value, the discounts and the total value to pay

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
